# infra

Cloudflare resources for allthings, declared with [Alchemy](https://alchemy.run) v2 in [`alchemy.run.ts`](alchemy.run.ts). Deploy state lives in Cloudflare (`Cloudflare.state()`), so every machine and CI see the same resources.

From `infra/`, sign in to Cloudflare once per machine (browser OAuth), then plan and deploy:

```sh
bun alchemy profile edit --add Cloudflare
bun run plan --stage prod     # preview changes to production
bun run deploy --stage prod   # apply them
bun run deploy                # your own stage (live_$USER) with its own resources
```

Only the `prod` stage gets the `media.allthings.dev` domain, and its bucket is kept even if removed from the stack.
